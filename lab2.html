	<h3> <i> What is HTML? </i> </h3> 
	

	<p> 
		HTML stand for <mark>Hypertext&nbsp;Markup&nbsp;Language</mark>, and it is responsible for displaying webpages. The most <br>
		recent version of HTML currently is HTML5.
	</p>
	

	
	<h3> <i> What is a Web Server? </i> </h3> 
	
	
	<p> 
		A Web Server is a computer connected to internet that has the main purpose of waiting for requests <br>
		from web browsers. Some of these requests include displaying web pages, images, movies, and videos. 
	</p>

	<h3> <i> What is ARPANET? </i> </h3> 
	

	<p> 
		<b> ARPANET</b>, which was created in 1969, was essentially the first version of the internet, which is an <br>
		interconnection of computers communicating using a set of rules. The network was created by ARPA  <br>
		(Advanced Research Projects Agency), who were funded by the <code> USA Department of Defense.</code> Originally, <br>
		ARPANET had four hosts at universities in Western US, and 128 host computers. 
	</p>

	<h3> <i> What is WWW? </i> </h3> 
	

	<p>
		<b> WWW</b>, or the <mark>World&nbsp;Wide&nbsp;Web</mark>, is a software application that makes use of the internet's vast <br>
		infrastructure and allowed computers to access documents of different kinds all over the interent. <br>
		It was created around 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee while he worked at <code> CERN Nuclear Physics Research Lab </code> <br>
		in Geneva Switzerland. 
	</p>
	
	<hr> 
	
	<h3> <i> What is Domain Name? </i> </h3>
	
	<p> 
		<b> Domain name </b> is essentially the name of a website. It is a virtual property that that can be bought <br>
		and owned by people. 
		
		<hr>
		
	<h3> <i> What is http? </i> </h3> 
	
	<p>
		<b> http </b> stands for <mark> &quot;hypertext&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;protocol&quot;</mark> and is a protocol that specifies how web pages are <br>
		delivered. The secure version of http is https, and all protocols are a primary component in URLs. 
	</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<h3> <i> What is W3C? </i> </h3> 
	
	<p>
		<b> W3C</b>, which stands for <mark> World&nbsp;Wide&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Consortium</mark>. The non-profit organization helped to end the browser <br>
		wars between the <code> Microsoft </code> and <code> Netscape </code> by releasing uniform standards for HTML and other web-related <br>
		technologies. It allowed browsers to work mostly the same way, and helped to mitigate immense competition. <br>
		W3C was created by Tim-Berners and others who helped create WWW. Major corporations like <code> Microsoft </code> and <br>
		<code> Netscape </code> also got seats at the table because their input was important. 
		
		<hr> 
	
	<h3> <i> What is URL? </i> </h3>  
	
	<p>
		<b> URL</b>, which stands for <mark>Uniform&nbsp;Resource&nbsp;Locator</mark>, has three primary components: the how, where, and what. <br>
		
	<pre>
		<small> The &quot;how&quot; is protocols like http and https that specify how web pages are delivered, as well as others <br>
		such as ftp, which initiate file downloads instead of temporary web page loading. The &quot;where&quot; is usually a <br>
		named address, but can also be a raw numeric IP address, which is the identity number every machine, software, <br>
		or website has. The &quot;what&quot; specifies a specific resource on the server, and also descends into subfolders <br>
		within the web site. </small>
